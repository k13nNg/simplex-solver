This is a C++ implementation of the famous [Simplex Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_algorithm), commonly used for solving [Linear Programming problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_algorithm).

This implementation takes as input a tableau, representing an LP in _**Standard Equality Form**_ (It is crucial that the LP is in _**Standard Equality Form**_. Otherwise, it will out put the incorrect solution!)
